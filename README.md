# MLLibrary
This is a machine learning library developed by Dallin Childs for CS5350/6350 at the University of Utah.

To run the perceptron algorithm, simply call the run.sh file in the Perceptron folder. The parameters can be specified via the constants at the top of the file, and which algorithm will run is determined by the call at the bottom. One of standard_perceptron, voted_perceptron, and averaged_perceptron can be called.
